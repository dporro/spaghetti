Short title: Tractome: Interactive tractography segmentation tool 

Tractome is a new interactive tool for human brain tractography segmentation. 
It supports neuroanatomists and medical doctors in their study of white matter anatomical structures from 
diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) data. Unlike previous systems for tractography segmentation, this is
a computer-assisted tool in which the user interacts with a summary of the tractography instead of the whole set
of streamlines. The summary is generated by clustering the tractography into a desired number of clusters, usually
in the order of tens or one hundred. The summary shows only one representative streamline for each cluster, so that
it is easier to interact with them in the 3D scene. The user can then iteratively select the representative streamlines
of interest and re-cluster the associated sets or streamlines into smaller ones in order to incrementally reveal details
of the anatomical structure of interest. The interaction is powered by novel efficient algorithms for fast clustering. 
Spaghetti is written in Python language and it supports the TrackVis format and the DiPy format for tractography files. 


*To execute the application:

- cd folder where the application is
- cd ui
- ipython --gui=qt mainwindow.py

Main functionalities:
- Loads structural (img, nii) and tractography (.dpy, .trk) files
- Interactive manipulation of the tractography data by showing representatives of computed clusters
- Allows picking, removing clusters (representatives) and re-clustering such that data can be better explored
- ROI masks (.nii) can be applied 
- ROI spheres can also be created to filter the data, and further re-clustered for a better exploration
